LMS-Pascal
==========

Library Management System in PASCAL (basic implementation)

Motivation
------------

I started this project as a school assignment and came up with a basic
implementation in a couple of weeks. The learning was imense and running
software on intel-286/386 was a treat. I have been one of the lucky ones
to work on those old intel machines and appreciate how far we have come.
This source is both nostalgic to me and probably a long pending dream
of learning pascal again.

I am adding this source in GPLv3 as-is (without modification). I have not
built it via any pascal compiler, but it used to work a very long time ago.
As told above this is my school project, so dont expect too great
a code, though I did enjoy making it then.
